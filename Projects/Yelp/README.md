# Yelp Rating Prediction
*This is a hypothetical project where, given a set of information about a user and a local business, the user's rating on the business is predicted on a continuous scale between 0 and 5.*

Yelp is an online platform where users can rate and write reviews on local businesses. Users can also browse the website and/or search local businesses of their interest.

To facilitate the user's browsing on Yelp's website, it has been decided to make customized recommendations on local businesses to each user by predicting how much they will be satisfied with the businesses.

In this hypothetical project, upwards of 120,000 consumer reviews on Yelp are analyzed to study the attributes of successful local businesses and understand the consumer preferences.

Following some exploratory and statistical analyses, a model predicting how much a given consumer will like a business on a continuous scale from 0 to 5 is created.

Finally, as the final product of this project, a customized recommendation system was programmed using the prediction model above such that every user is recommended 10 nearby business locations. This and the following notebooks summarize the findings and results.
