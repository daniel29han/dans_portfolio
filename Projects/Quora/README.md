# Quora Sincere/Insincere Questions
*This is the repository of a hypothetical project where, given a set of questions on Quora, the user's sincerity of the question is classified as either sincere or insincere.*

Quora is a social question-and-answer website based in Mountain View, California, where users can collaborate by editing questions and commenting on answers that have been submitted by other users.

While the convenience that anyone can post and edit questions on the forum allows users to dynamically engage in the service, the downside is that some users may post insincere questions which would compromise the reliability of the website and/or degrade other groups of individuals.

In this hypothetical project, the characteristics of insincere questions on Quora are studied using machine learning techniques, and a classification model predicting whether or not a question in sincere is created based on the underlying logic.
