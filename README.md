# Thank You for Checking Out my Portfolio. I'm Daniel!

This repository contains the projects I have worked on or am currently on. As I am currently 4 months into my program ending in December, these projects do not yet encompass the entire aspects of a Data Science/Analysis project. As such, as the course progresses, I will add to and modify the projects actively in the Agile manner - that is, everytime you visit this repository, you will find upgraded versions of my projects!

As mentioned earlier, my program ends this December and I will be equipped with all the necessary knowledge, skills and techniques that a Data Scientist must have. In the meantime, please check out my projects and feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or via email!
